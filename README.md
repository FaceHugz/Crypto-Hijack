# Hocus-Pocus
This Python tool I created generates random Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets, checks their balances via external APIs (Blockcypher, Etherscan), and securely stores wallets with balances in an encrypted SQLite database. It also attempts brute-force attacks to find private keys for specific wallet addresses.
